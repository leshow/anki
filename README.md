# Anki Deck

In this collection is about 3000 cards, I have completed all but one of the decks. The wonderful deck which I got from [interactive-coding-challenges](https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges) contains a lot of great problems but I find working through them time consuming, so I only do a new problem from it every week or two.

The rest of the decks are fairly highly focused around computer science & PL. With the bulk of them in 'Computer Science' (2k cards). I have a Haskell deck, and a Rust deck. The contents of the cards I've made for myself may be of questionable usefulness to anyone else, since they partially revolve around queues that might not be shared by another person, but I'll leave them here for completeness. There is also several git decks I've pulled together from around the web, some basic calc (derivatives), an English words deck to improve my vocabulary, etc.

I started studying regularly around January/Febuary of 2017. I hope this collection continues to grow and I continue to study over time, I've found it very rewarding to work on memory recall and see improvements.
