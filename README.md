# Anki

In this collection is about 3000 cards which anki shows based on previous memory. I haven't yet fully completed the wonderful  [interactive-coding-challenges](https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges) contains a lot of great problems but I find working through them time consuming, so I only do a new problem from it every week or two.

The rest of the decks are fairly highly focused around computer science & PL. With the bulk of them in 'Computer Science' (2k cards). I have a Haskell deck, and a Rust deck. The contents of the cards I've made for myself may be of questionable usefulness to anyone else, since they partially revolve around queues that might not be shared by another person, but I'll leave them here for completeness. There is also several git decks I've pulled together from around the web, some basic calc (derivatives), an English words deck to improve my vocabulary, etc. 

I started studying regularly around January/Febuary of 2017. I hope this collection continues to grow and I continue to study over time, I've found it very rewarding to work on memory recall and see improvements in acuity.

Some decks are new and sorely lacking, the Stats and Linux deck stand out. I'm open to PRs on any deck that improves or adds useful information.
