In this collection is about 3300 cards.

## About

The decks are fairly focused around computer science & PLT. With the bulk of them in 'Computer Science' (2k cards). The contents of the cards I've made for myself may be of questionable usefulness to anyone else, since they partially revolve around queues that might not be shared by another person, but I'll leave them here anyway if someone can find a use for them. 

I started studying regularly around January/Febuary of 2017. I hope this collection continues to grow and I continue to study over time, I've found it very rewarding to work on memory recall and see improvements in acuity.

## Decks

- Bash & cli  -- some common bash/zsh commands, aliases, vim hotkeys, etc
- BaseCS -- cards made from [basecs](https://medium.com/basecs) (only a few done here)
- Category theory -- nothing too involved, some Haskell specific stuff (isomorphism, injective/surjective, monoid, applicative)
- Coding -- coding challenges from [interactive-coding-challenges](https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges)  
- Comp Sci -- a bunch of random CS questions, some coding problems too
- Electronics -- basic electronics stuff: resistors in parallel/series, diodes, ohm's law, pull up resistors, etc
- English words -- some of my favorite and uncommon english words
- Git -- big 'ol deck of uncommon git commands and aliases. No use putting in git pull or anything that you use all the time
- Haskell -- Haskell topics that have interested me or that I want to remember
- JS -- nothing too involved, just a few js slides on stuff that's easy to mix up, substring/substr type of thing
- Linux -- very underdeveloped deck
- Math -- common derivatives, basic trig, circumference of circle, combinations/permutations questions, binomial distribution
- Python -- underdeveloped, random python syntax
- Rusty -- Some Rust idioms and topics I'd like to remember Fn/FnMut/FnOnce, std::pin, Iterator, unsafe stuff, etc
- Type systems -- not very much here: contravariance/covariance 
- linear algebra -- underdeveloped right now
- postgresql -- couple PG questions
